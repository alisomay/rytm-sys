# rytm-sys

This crate provides the necessary bindings to the fork of [libanalogrytm](https://github.com/alisomay/libanalogrytm) library for encode/decoding sysex messages to Analog Rytm and provides necessary data structures to work with them.

Here is the link to the original upstream [libanalogrytm](https://github.com/bsp2/libanalogrytm) library.
